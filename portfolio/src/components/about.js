            Hi, I'm Ashley. 
            I'm a Kansas City native who's decided it's time for a new adventure. 
            After six years behind the chair in a high end salon, I was ready for something 
            new. I'm hoping to blend those two worlds together to achieve a fulfilling 
            career. 
            When I'm not camped out at my desk, I'm spending quality time with my husband
            Sam and our cat Shortcake.
